# Old files, not to be re-produced

These files, are ancient, and are meant
for legacy testing.

Either, to raise warnings when people use them,
or to ensure that they are still accessible.

Either way, they will never be reproduced, and
any use of them should be discouraged.
At some point we shouldn't allow them any more.
