# VASP calculations for a NO molecule #

This folder contains a series of VASP calculations for a small
diatomic molecule (nitric oxide) that hosts an unpaired spin.

Calculations are performed with VASP version 5.4.4 in three
different flavors:
- unpolarized
- polarized
- spin-orbit

In subdirectories, separate calculations for the lm-decomposed
DOSCAR and PROCAR are found (LORBIT=10 flag).
